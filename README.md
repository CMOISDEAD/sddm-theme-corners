# corners: theme for SDDM
wasn't really a fan of preexisting [SDDM](https://github.com/sddm/sddm) themes, so I made my own. screenshots config etc incoming

mostly just wanted to get basic functionality working, so aesthetics are uhhh not the best. will be fixing this!!

kinda inspired by [sddm-chinese-painting-theme](https://github.com/fralonra/sddm-chinese-painting-theme)
